# we need an interface to create new entries for annotation, i.e. additional data formats, algorithms, etc

# we reuse existing ontologies, such as EDAM or SWO, for that purpose. 
It is important to stick to the conventions of these ontologies, otherwise its a mess
 regarding swo for example, an analysis showed certain commonalities across subclasses of one specific type -> try to automate the creation of the required relationships when entering a new term. Keep it simple!

For example regarding data format, EDAM http://edamontology.org/format_2350 [ Format (By type of data) us used ]

We need the following features:
	Select Top Level class (eg data format, algorithm, etc) 
		edit and add terms
