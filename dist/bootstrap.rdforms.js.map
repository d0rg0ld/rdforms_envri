You may also load Dojo with\n\t//\t\tany AMD-compliant loader via the package main module dojo/main.\n\t// description:\n\t//\t\tThis is the \"source loader\" for Dojo. It provides an AMD-compliant loader that can be configured\n\t//\t\tto operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes. After the loader is defined, dojo is loaded\n\t//\t\tIAW the package main module dojo/main. In the event you wish to use a foreign loader, you may load dojo as a package\n\t//\t\tvia the package main module dojo/main and this loader is not required; see dojo/package.json for details.\n\t//\n\t//\t\tIn order to keep compatibility with the v1.x line, this loader includes additional machinery that enables\n\t//\t\tthe dojo.provide, dojo.require et al API. This machinery is loaded by default, but may be dynamically removed\n\t//\t\tvia the has.js API and statically removed via the build system.\n\t//\n\t//\t\tThis loader includes sniffing machinery to determine the environment; the following environments are supported:\n\t//\n\t//\t\t- browser\n\t//\t\t- node.js\n\t//\t\t- rhino\n\t//\n\t//\t\tThis is the so-called \"source loader\". As such, it includes many optional features that may be discarded by\n\t//\t\tbuilding a customized version with the build system.\n\n\t// Design and Implementation Notes\n\t//\n\t// This is a dojo-specific adaption of bdLoad, donated to the dojo foundation by Altoviso LLC.\n\t//\n\t// This function defines an AMD-compliant (http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition)\n\t// loader that can be configured to operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes.\n\t//\n\t// Since this machinery implements a loader, it does not have the luxury of using a load system and/or\n\t// leveraging a utility library. This results in an unpleasantly long file; here is a road map of the contents:\n\t//\n\t//\t 1. Small library for use implementing the loader.\n\t//\t 2. Define the has.js API; this is used throughout the loader to bracket features.\n\t//\t 3. Define the node.js and rhino sniffs and sniff.\n\t//\t 4. Define the loader's data.\n\t//\t 5. Define the configuration machinery.\n\t//\t 6. Define the script element sniffing machinery and sniff for configuration data.\n\t//\t 7. Configure the loader IAW the provided user, default, and sniffing data.\n\t//\t 8. Define the global require function.\n\t//\t 9. Define the module resolution machinery.\n\t//\t10. Define the module and plugin module definition machinery\n\t//\t11. Define the script injection machinery.\n\t//\t12. Define the window load detection.\n\t//\t13. Define the logging API.\n\t//\t14. Define the tracing API.\n\t//\t16. Define the AMD define function.\n\t//\t17. Define the dojo v1.x provide/require machinery--so called \"legacy\" modes.\n\t//\t18.

In the latter case\n\t\t//\t\tpostscript() will be called after the construction.\n\t\t//\n\t\t//\t\tAll chaining hints are \"inherited\" from base classes and\n\t\t//\t\tpotentially can be overridden. Be very careful when overriding\n\t\t//\t\thints! Make sure that all chained methods can work in a proposed\n\t\t//\t\tmanner of chaining.\n\t\t//\n\t\t//\t\tOnce a method was chained, it is impossible to unchain it. The\n\t\t//\t\tonly exception is \"constructor\".
